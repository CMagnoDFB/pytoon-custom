## Overview 
PyToon is a Python-based animation library for automatically animating characters and their mouth movements from just an audio file (.mp3 or .wav) of a person speaking English. This tool uses machine learning-based audio analysis techniques to automatically lip-sync animated character mouth movements to a given audio recording of someone talking. It is designed to easily overlay the generated animation over custom background videos in a "presentation" style video format. You can see an example of a PyToon generated animation in the YouTube link below:

## This is a customized version of pytoon that generates only the visemes.
